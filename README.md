# Semantic Segmentation

### Project description

Pixel wise classification is implemented via a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) making use of a VGG16 encoder pre-trained on Imagenet for optimal performances.  
  
Two databases are used for training:   
- Kitti (http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php)   
- Cityscape (https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)  

The FCN8s network is trained to perform pixel wise classification among 20 classes as per official cityscapes benchmark.  

The implementation is tested againt the official cityscapes test set in terms of IOU metric.  
Optimizations on the inference part are being done thanks to the use of Tensorflow freeze, optimize and transform_graph tools.  
cf https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/README.md  
A demonstration video is provided: based on cityscapes video sequences for qualitative evalutaion.

The current status in terms of performance is the following:  
* cityscape test set IOU: 73.48% with (256, 512) input images.   
So with a subsampling of 4 compared to raw inputs and ground truth provided by cityscapes
* inference time on a GTX 1080 TI: 63 ms per image with 32 bits weights  

### Introduction
In this project, you'll label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

### Start
##### Implement
Implement the code in the `main.py` module indicated by the "TODO" comments.
The comments indicated with "OPTIONAL" tag are not required to complete.
##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```
**Note** If running this in Jupyter Notebook system messages, such as those regarding test status, may appear in the terminal rather than the notebook.

### Submission
1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests.
2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/989/view).
3. Submit the following in a zip file.
 - `helper.py`
 - `main.py`
 - `project_tests.py`
 - Newest inference images from `runs` folder  (**all images from the most recent run**)
