Found possible Python library paths:
  /home/philippew/anaconda3/envs/pythonx/lib/python3.5/site-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/home/philippew/anaconda3/envs/pythonx/lib/python3.5/site-packages]

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with jemalloc as malloc support? [Y/n]: Y
jemalloc as malloc support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [Y/n]: n
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [Y/n]: n
No Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Amazon S3 File System support? [Y/n]: n
No Amazon S3 File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [y/N]: y
XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GDR support? [y/N]: N
No GDR support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with VERBS support? [y/N]: N

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL support? [y/N]: N
No OpenCL support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to default to CUDA 8.0]: 


Please specify the location where CUDA 8.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]: 


Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 6.0]: 


Please specify the location where cuDNN 6 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:


Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size. [Default is: 6.1]


Do you want to use clang as CUDA compiler? [y/N]: N
nvcc will be used as CUDA compiler.

Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]: 


Do you wish to build TensorFlow with MPI support? [y/N]: N
No MPI support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]: 


Add "--config=mkl" to your bazel command to build with MKL support.
Please note that MKL on MacOS or windows is still not supported.
If you would like to use a local MKL instead of downloading, please set the environment variable "TF_MKL_ROOT" every time before build.
